            This has caused some coffee geeks to refer to it as a 'burnt' coffee.French roast is considered to be a double roast coffee. This is a category of dark roasted coffee

        <br />
        <p style="width:50%">Our organic Colombian coffee comes in both dark and medium roasts. It is full-bodied with tones of citrus and ripe fruit, with the dark roast offering a rich bittersweetness. 
            Our Loring coffee roaster employs clean roasting technology which enhances this coffee’s subtleties. Our beans come from the Huila department of Colombia, a region of small coffee farms in the 
            shadow of the Nevado del Huila volcano. Rich volcanic soil combined with optimal climate and altitude are the necessary elements for growing excellent coffee. This cooperative of small farms grows 
            mostly caturra and colombia varietals, which are pulped, fermented for 24 hours, and fully washed resulting in a smooth complex cup.
